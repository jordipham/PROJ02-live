      <h2>Proposition: In the economic sector of low carbon technology, Eastern Hemisphere countries are being taken advantage of as they take on unequal burdens of the trade balance in the global effort of reducing carbon emissions.</h2>

        <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

          <figcaption>The goal of the visualization above is to show that European and Asian trade powers are strong exporters of low-carbon technology. Layered in with the topic of climate change and carbon emissions, it can lead to a variety of different implications, which in this case, I targetted the expectation that global warming is a problem that holds a united front from all countries.</figcaption>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Manipulation of Histogram Characteristics (Score: -1.5) - I initially chose a histogram for my project because I believed it had the most potential in terms of manipulation to create a persuasive and deceptive visualization. 
                In order to do that, I specifically played around with the x-axis so that it was slightly magnified onto a chosen range of numbers, gave the histogram an excessive number of bins to create, and lowered the bin gap to 0 so all the bars are squished together. 
                All of these choices work together in regards to persuasiveness by creating visual emphasis around the huge net export that I was targetting since the bars appear more zoomed in and there is not much visual space for the data to be scrutinized, and that is what 
                worked well because it forces viewers to have an up-close interpretation of where the import/export rates are concentrated at. Something that I believed didn't work well is that it made the histogram a bit choppy in terms of where the bars were; this is a consequence that 
                stemmed from the input of a big amount of bins - it was inevitable that some bins could be overpopulated while other bins had almost no density. One of the alternatives I had instead of using a histogram was to use a trendline where the area below the line was shaded. While it
                backup my proposition in the same way the histogram did, I believed this trendline idea would have been too upfront and transparent, which would give viewers room to bring down my argument.
            </li>
            <li>Transformation of Data (Score: -1.5) - A big part of the creation of my histograms was the manipulation/cleaning of data in order to create deception. First and foremost, I specifically picked out countries that could create the visualization I wanted, but I labeled it in a more general manner. For example,
                instead of labeling it as "China, Korea, Japan" and all the Asian countries I filtered for, I just labeled that histogram of trade flows as Asia. Furthermore, when it came to the values of the trade flows, I filtered to numbers that were the trade flow's percent share of GDP because 
                in terms of persuasiveness, it gives the viewer a better picture of what I'm actually trying to show. Essentially, the persuasiveness of this design choice in the data transformation is that I'm nitpicking what I actually want so that the visualization appears in my favor - the only
                bit of earnestness in this choice is that I picked interpretable numbers; the rest is only intended as deception. I handpicked countries where their exports would heavily cluster at higher numbers than their imports, but then I labeled it with general titles as to mask which countries
                I actually chose. What worked well about this is that I am directly showing my propositon without showing my cards, but what did not work well in this data transformation was how much data I lost which does have a direct influence in the general make-up of the histogram. Some alternatives
                I considered when transforming my data was to add more countries to each of my subsets for the visualizations that were for my proposition. It didn't necessarily go wrong in terms of destroying my proposition, but it definitely grew less convincing since the densities of different
                trade flow ranges were starting to grow dense and would later conflict with my annotations; thus, I settled for transforming the data by picking countries that created the best densities to show the positive net exports.
            </li>
            <li>Color Choices (Score: -0.5) - My color choices of blue and an orangey-yellowy shade are intended to part of a color-blnd friendly palette but still mainly hold deceptive intent. However, since blue is for import and the orangey-yellow is for exports, these color choices contribute to persuasiveness as they create 
                clear distinction between the two categories of trade flow, so from an initial look in combination with directed annotations, it is obvious which one is ahead and how the proposition was crafted. Something that worked well with this color palette was not only the accessibility 
                but also how the proposition is portrayed. Some parts of the distribution have imports and exports overlapping but instead of the colors getting lost in one another, their opacity causes the colors to mix a bit, and the overlap is easily identifiable. Something that did not work well
                would be the basic association between the colors and what they represent. The color choices are more geared towards representation in the current visualization versus a universal representation. Furthermore, I believe the shade of blue to some eyes could be seen as a bit dominant
                in comparison to the shade of orangey-yellow. Some alternatives in color choices that could have been made would have been a grayscale or monochromatic palette. I stuck to my two shades though because grayscale would have been too neutral while monochomatic palettes could've given
                the implication that all the data is of the same category. Using two different colors allows for the distinction between two categories and allows for easy identification.             
            </li>
            <li>Labels, Titles, and Directed Annotations (Score: 1.5) - The most earnest part about the visualization that is for my proposition is the title, labels, and annotations. They let readers know what each axis represents, which region the visualization is for, and in regards to 
                persuasiveness, they direct the readers attention to a specific portion of the graph and highlight what is important there to my proposition. These characteristics could be totally earnest at a score of 2 but due to how they are targeted and intend to highlight specific things, they have slight
                aspects of deceptiveness since they pull the viewers' eyes to a specific portion (thus, the smaller earnest score). Something that works well about these labels, titles, and annotations is that they do help my argument and help the viewer receive a bit of context on what they are looking at.
                Something that they fail at though is extreme specificity. It relates the data to what is on the axis, but considering this is a histogram, my titles, labels, and annotations don't exactly quantify much like "oh, this proportion of the data is in this class" and what not. Alternatives to
                this design choice would have been to tone down the annotations and labels. To some extent it could argued that they are extremely distracting, but on the other hand, I settled on the choice to include them because without them, the visualization would lack a lot of direction and be too plain.
