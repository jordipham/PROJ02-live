      <h2>Proposition: In the economic sector of low carbon technology, Eastern Hemisphere countries are being taken advantage of as they take on unequal burdens of the trade balance in the global effort of reducing carbon emissions.</h2>

      <section>
        <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jordipham/PROJ02-live/13c7d6e1ba63e1370c0fd1c5a922628d221d2493/images/PROJ02%20-%20DSC106%20Data%20Visualization-FOR.svg" alt="" style="width: 100%; height: 100%;"/>
          <figcaption>The goal of the visualization above is to show that European and Asian trade powers in the Eastern Hemisphere are strong exporters of low-carbon technology. Layered in with the topic of climate change and carbon emissions, it can lead to a variety of different implications, which in this case, 
            I targetted the expectation that global warming is a problem that holds a united front from all countries yet these particular regions look to be taking on a major chunk of the work.
        </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Manipulation of Histogram Characteristics (Score: -1.5) - I chose to use a histogram as the basis of my visualization instead of a line graph or some variation of a trendline because its characteristics have far more potential in terms of manipulation to create a visualization
                that is for my proposition. By manipulating the axes, number of bins, and bars, the histogram is persuasive in that it forces viewers to have a close-up interpretation of the information, but it came up short visually as it came out slighty choppy since some bins are overpopulated 
                while others had almost no density. I settled on the histogram over other visualization choices because I believed the others would've been too transparent and upfront, giving viewers more room to bring down my argument.
            </li>
            <li>Transformation of Data (Score: -1.5) - Instead of using every single country in each of the major trade regions of the Eastern Hemisphere, I chose to transform the dataset so that it would be more curated towards my proposition. This choice improves the persuasiveness of the visualization in
                element of deception. By choosing only specific countries that support my proposition but labeling it under a more general term, the densities of exports and imports better portray my proposition; however, what did not work well is that I would lose a bit of the data. While I could've
                included every region in my visualization and done less filtering and transformation, I settled on the filtering since it better supports my proposition; I experimented with using all countries and it did not take away from my proposition, but it made the trend less observable.
            </li>
            <li>Color Choices (Score: 1) - I chose to use two distinct shades of color from a colorblind friendly palette instead of grayscale or monochromatic palettes because I wanted to create unique identifications for each trade flow. It works well in separating the two and maintains accessibility; what I
                believe came up short was that I maybe chose a shade of blue that may slightly be a bit dominant in contrast to the orangey-yellow. However, I settled because I need easy identification and distinction; choosing colors from a grayscale or monochromatic palette could give implications that the 
                distributions are of the same category since they stem from the same color.             
            </li>
            <li>Labels, Titles, and Directed Annotations (Score: 1.5) - The titles, labels, and directed annotations are intended to guide my viewers through the visualization, and they are persuasive in the aspect that they show the viewers exactly where the in the visualization the propositions
                stems from. They work well in the context of the visualization because they create clarity of what is being viewed and give direction on how to view it; they could be argued to come up short in the context of the histogram itself since they do not specify what proportion is what and 
                are just focused on saying where the graph is most dense. I settled on adding these annotations though I considered a lighter amount of words all over my graph because I need to pinpoint the observable trends that really help my proposition.
            </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jordipham/PROJ02-live/e89641d3cdd8c6f288d77021ad1d7e2dd4b94db4/images/PROJ02%20-%20DSC106%20Data%20Visualization-AGAINST.svg"" alt="" style="width: 100%; height: 100%;"/>
          <figcaption>In the "against" visualization, the trend that was noticed in Eastern Hemisphere regions is completely reversed in the global economy. Now it appears that everyone is a major importer of low-carbon technology and can be made ethical when asking if countries are greedy and in it for themselves as they don't appear to export nearly as much of such technology.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Histogram Characteristics (Score: -1.5) - Following my "for" proposition, a histogram once again maintains easy elements of manipulation and deception; thus, I kept the underlying graph choice consistent and all rationale is still as follows from the "for" visualiztions.
            </li>
            <li>Transformation of Data (Score: 0) - The only data transformation done in the "against" visualization was filtering so that all the numbers represented the same thing. Other than that, nothing was filtered, so the data is still relatively untouched, meaning all countries are still
                available in the dataset when plotted. 
            </li>
            <li>Color Choices (Score: 1) - Once again, my color choices are meant to create distinction compared to using color scales where they all stem from the same color and can imply that the data is from the same category.
            </li>
            <li>Labels, Titles and Directed Annotations (Score: 1.5) - My titles, axes, and annotations are still intended to guide the viewer as in what is important to argue against the proposition and the rationale remains consistent.
            </li>
            <li>Mean Lines (Score: 1) - I chose to add vertical dashed lines that represent the means as to exaggerate the difference in imports and exports, which got reversed when I plotted against my proposition. It does well because it highlights the most integral part to what
                could be used against my proposition and leads to easy interpretability, but what may have come up short about this choice is that in terms of information, it can taken in the wrong direction if I don't provide substantial context or if the context I provide is hard to understand.
                Whiel I may have been able to just use the visualization without these lines, I chose to include them because upon first glance, it provides a super easy bit of information that takes away from the proposition and helps argue against it.
            </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

        <p>The overall design process across both visualizations, for and against my proposition about unequal trade balances, revolved strongly around omitting data and manipulating the physical features of the density histogram.
            In general, I first had to filter out values; the original data had values that were either the trade flow as a raw unit, as a share of the GDP, or as a share of the overall import/export. I chose the trade flow as a share of GDP so that the information made
            more sense in terms of interpretability. When it came to the "for" visualization, I specifically curated the dataset for specific countries where the exports outweighed the imports, but it wasn't exactly that exaggerated. If it was too exaggerated, I felt that 
            it would have been too obvious where data was omitted, but if the exports outweighted the imports at a moderate amount, it still supported my proposition but my data omission would've been masked. Furthermore, I chose generalized labels of "Asia" and "Europe" to
            give the impression that I was showing those regions with full transparency. When it came to my "against" propositon, I did not have to do as much manipulation to get my visualization to argue against my argument. The observation made when the dataset wasn't 
            manipulated was already a reverse of what I manipulated for when I designed for my "for" visualization. Beyond the data manipulation, it came down to how the histogram was displayed. As noted in my design rationales, I created an excessive number of bins, left zero space between bars, and magnified the 
            axes so that the visualization would appear more zoomed in. My thought process behind the density histogram was that if zoomed in, the viewer cannot exactly see the entire distribution and would focus more on the condensed sections of the graph. This would be where the colors come in: blue and orangey-yellow.
            These colors are distinct from one another. In the for proposition, they would see the export color ahead of the import color in terms of density, which is what my proposition targets (positive net exports). In the against proposition, the colors once again help identify where is densest, but this time,
            the lines repesenting means are layered in, too, to show that the imports are ahead of the exports, which immeidately shut down the "for" proposition. All in all, the deception of my visualizations come from under-the-hood data omission and physical visualization manipulation whereas the earnestness
            comes from annotations and directions to guide the viewer in understanding what is being seen.
        </p>
        <p> Coming into the project, I felt that the conceptual part about making a visualization deceptive was quite straightforward; the true difficult part would be the execution. Choosing the climate change sub-dataset of trade balances in the low-carbon technology sector, I felt a bit lost
            at first because the dataset was arguably on the small side, so my main approach to succeed in this project would be more topic-based compared to having a humongous dataset where observable trends would quickly unveil themselves. What surprised me here was that by taking
            the topic-based approach, I could craft a proposition and then use deceptive tactics that would allow my dataset to actually support it. I definitely had a lot of prior knowledge in terms of trade balances and trade flows, and one thing that definitely took advantage of that
            in this project was that our proposition was going to take a strong position to essentially assert some variation of ethics. In other words, looking at basic trade flows and trade balances won't exactly give any information when visualized if just visualized plainly. I realized
            that I needed to make some statement about trade even if economically, it doesn't necessarily hold that implication. A net import or export does not say much about a country being greedy or heavily burdened. The visualization can say that, but the annotations and provactive titling
            must also be present for my proposition to pull through, and thats the exact execution that I had hoped to pull off. Through methods of cleaning, manipulating, and omission, the data showed me a favorable trend to the assertive position that I had taken: 
            Europe and Asia have heavier burdens in this global warming problem - they export/provide more of these carbon reducing products than they buy them themselves; on top of that, it also plays into basic expectation that people would believe climate change efforts to be a 
            globally united affair. I simply chose a side and then manipulated the data to visualize my proposition and inject a provocative ethical take into the project. From a pure economic view, net exports or impacts have very marginal implications, but layered with the topic of 
            global warming, now there is room for questions to be asked if everyone is actually contributing. 
        </p>
        <p>To be completely transparent, I would not say that there is a concrete definition to ethical analysis and visualization. If anything, I would describe it as visualizing data in a manner where all parties are properly captured and accurately represented. Furthermore, it
            also contains a level of honesty with your intended audience so they understand how you finalized your visualization. There are definitely strict boundaries such as if data is falsified or just completely wrong, but for the most part, there is just tons of gray area, 
            particular when it comes to data omission, where bits of data are simply ignored in the final result. In my project, as the designer, when I chose to filter for countries that would help my density histogram plot in favor of my propositions, I would say I definitely
            entered a realm of dishonesty in my visualization even though it helped me drive the point home. When it comes to the physical manipulation of the chosen graphs themselves, I believe those persuasive decisions are acceptable. Manipulating the graphs can create a more focused 
            perspective for your viewer such as boxing in certain aspects that are important, but it doesn't take away from the visualization as a whole because its still there - you never actually deleted anything, you just pointed out a vital part of the visualization to your proposition. On 
            the other hand, extreme omission of data would be a misleading persuasive tactics. I would say that there is a spectrum to how this can be done. If we were to revisit my decision to omit data, I believe my decision is not as extreme. Yes, I still handpicked countries that would
            make my proposition favorable; however, I did make sure that the countries I did handpick were among the strongest trade powers of their region, meaning that countries I ignored might not be the best countries to include. If I was omitting data that was actually vital, say I was exploring
            trade on the Asian continent and I excluded China, which is a humongous trade power, than yes that hits a level of extreme omission because I'm ignoring an objectively crucial piece in what I'm exploring. What I intend to conclude is that some cases of misleading visualizing tactics are 100%
            unacceptable, but for the most part, lots of these topics operate in a gray area and only feedback from the right audience can truly unveil how deceptive they truly are. The correct bound to draw between the two is hard to strictly define, but if anything, it comes down to a matter
            of if it takes away from the integrity of the data such as losing representation or losing information about a group or category.
